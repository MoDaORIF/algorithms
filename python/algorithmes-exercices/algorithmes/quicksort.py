    This function selects the leftmost element as the pivot and iterates through the

    the pivot, it swaps that element with the one at the current pivot index. The
    process continues until all elements have been compared. Finally, the pivot element
    is placed in its correct position, and its index is returned.

    This function also includes visualization code to display the algorithm's progress
    in a graphical window, using the `paint.rectangle` function to color the
    bars and `pygame.time.delay` to control the speed of the visualization.
